Q. 1) Explain all the CSS positions(static, fixed, sticky, relative, absolute) with one code example each.
Ans- 1. Static:
The default position value for an element is static. In this position, the element follows the normal document flow and is not affected by the positioning properties.
example of code:- 
<div class="static-position">
  This is a static positioned element.
</div>

<style>
.static-position {
  position: static;
}
</style>

2.Fixed:
A fixed positioned element is positioned relative to the browser window. It stays fixed even when the page is scrolled.
example of code:- 
<div class="fixed-position">
  This is a fixed positioned element.
</div>

<style>
.fixed-position {
  position: fixed;
  top: 20px;
  right: 20px;
}
</style>

3. Sticky:
A sticky positioned element is positioned based on the user's scroll position. It acts like relative within its parent element until a certain threshold is met, and then it becomes fixed relative to the viewport.
example of code:- 
<div class="sticky-position">
  This is a sticky positioned element.
</div>

<style>
.sticky-position {
  position: sticky;
  top: 50px;
}
</style>

4. Relative:
A relatively positioned element is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow. It can be moved using the top, right, bottom, and left properties.
<div class="relative-position">
  This is a relatively positioned element.
</div>

<style>
.relative-position {
  position: relative;
  top: 20px;
  left: 50px;
}
</style>

5. Absolute:
An absolutely positioned element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor or the initial containing block. It is taken out of the normal document flow.
example of code:-
<div class="absolute-position">
  This is an absolutely positioned element.
</div>

<style>
.absolute-position {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50px;
  right: 20px;
}
</style>

the actual effect of these positions will depend on the context and other CSS properties applied to the elements.
